I started using GNU\Linux in March 2008 with Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy
Gibbon). I was working in the news at the time and was using Linux for
photo and video production.

In 2012, I switched to the ArchLinux distribution and felt fine for 6
years.

These distributions are great, but they have one big problem: you need
to reconfigure it. With Ubuntu it happened twice a year, with Arch -
every time with new computer.

Problem solved for me with NixOS in October 2018.

This configuration not perfect and need some refactoring, but I use it
everyday on two machines.

Entrypoint is [[file:flake.nix][flake.nix]]. It describes inputs and outputs from
configuration.

In section "Modules" you can see which modules in use.
As example [[file:nixos-thinkpad-host.nix][nixos-thinkpad-host.nix]] describes specific things for my
current laptop Lenovo ThinkPad L580.

All other things - git, sound, fonts and other modules are the same for both my machines.

Fell free to ask me about my configuration: nekifirus@gmail.com
